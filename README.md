# LLM_Powered_Simple_Chatbot_Using_LangGraph
This project demonstrates how to build a simple LLM-powered chatbot using **LangGraph**, a library that enables building stateful, agentic workflows on top of Language Models. It integrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a graph-based workflow design to allow controlled and modular interactions.
